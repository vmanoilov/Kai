private const val TOOL_DESCRIPTION = """Execute a shell command in a Kali Linux sandbox and return stdout, stderr, exit code, and current working directory. The environment is a full Kali Linux system running via proot.

Shell session is PERSISTENT across calls within THIS conversation: cwd, exported environment variables, and any in-shell state carry from one call to the next, just like a normal terminal. So "cd /tmp" in one call, then "pwd" in the next, returns "/tmp". You do NOT need to chain "cd dir && command" unless you want directory changes to be one-shot. Other conversations and the in-app Terminal tab each have their own isolated shells; the rootfs and /root are still shared on disk, so files persist across all of them.

Pre-installed: bash, python3 (pip), nodejs, git, curl, wget, jq, plus remote-server tools — ssh, scp, sftp (openssh-client), lftp (FTP/FTPS), rsync. Use them directly, e.g. "ssh user@host 'remote command'", "sftp user@host", "lftp -c 'open ftp://...; put file'". Authentication state (~/.ssh keys, known_hosts) persists.

For SSH workflows: prefer the ssh_configure_host tool once per remote — it writes ~/.ssh/config so subsequent calls don't have to repeat host/user/port/identity flags. After registering, invoke ssh BY THE ALIAS: `ssh myalias 'cmd'`, `scp file myalias:`, `sftp myalias`. The whole point of the config is to feed the alias; bypassing it with `user@host` discards every setting the tool just wrote.

Note: SSH multiplexing (ControlMaster) is intentionally NOT enabled — Android's kernel-level link() restriction prevents openssh from creating its control socket inside this sandbox. Each ssh call does a full TCP+auth handshake. That is the correct, expected behavior here; do not try to force it back on with -o ControlMaster=auto or by writing your own ControlPath — it will produce a muxserver_listen Permission denied error.

Password-only servers (no key auth): this shell can't answer interactive password prompts directly (no PTY, ssh reads from /dev/tty). Heredoc stdin will NOT deliver a password. Install sshpass once with `apt install sshpass`, then drive the connection as `sshpass -p '<password>' ssh <alias> '<remote-cmd>'` — or `sshpass -f <password-file> ssh <alias>` to keep the password off the command line. sshpass fakes a PTY internally, which is the only path that actually works.

Limits and behavior:
- Output is capped at 15000 characters per stream; for large output, pipe through head/tail.
- Default timeout: 30s, max: 60s. Long-running interactive commands (e.g. ssh sessions held across messages) work because the shell is persistent — but a SINGLE call still hits the timeout if it doesn't return.
- Fullscreen TUIs (top, htop, vim, less, nano, anything ncurses) WILL NOT WORK — the sandbox has no PTY. Use non-interactive variants: "top -bn1" for a one-shot snapshot, "ps aux" for processes, redirect editor output, etc.
- Set background=true to run a long-lived process detached from the shell (writes to its own session_id). Use manage_process to check on it.
- Set fresh=true to run in a one-shot isolated shell that doesn't share state with the persistent session. Useful when you specifically want isolation; rarely needed.

Install extra packages with: apt install <package>

To show a file you produced in /root to the user, call open_file with the path relative to /root (e.g. open_file path="page.html"). File needs to be self-contained."""
